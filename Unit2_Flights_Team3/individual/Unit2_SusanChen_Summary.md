From the evaluation of both baseline model and engineered model, it shows that with more features added to the model  it will help the prediction of the model to be better. It provides a rich and potentially more predictive information, but there are still features or interactions that are undiscovered that may be better for prediction. But there are improvements done by the engineered model such as the increase of precision and recall, meaning that the model is getting better at predicting flights that are diverted compared to the baseline model. It is also proved by the ROC score that it is getting better at distinguishing the positive and negative class. Including features does help with building a better predictive model, but it requires the feature to have a significant influence on the result.

The custom threshold of 0.75 did not change the prediction of positive and negative classes. Even though setting it at 0.1 will give a result of 7515 false negatives, it takes a compromise of 11 in false positives which were 0 in threshold 0.5 and 0.75. When using different thresholds, it is important to balance the tradeoff between FN and FP and consider which one has a lower opportunity cost. After the consideration of the threshold, FP will give off more financial risk towards the airline by spending unnecessary money waiting for something that will not even happen. With better feature engineering, it will lower the cases for both FP/FN instead of having tradeoffs between them.
