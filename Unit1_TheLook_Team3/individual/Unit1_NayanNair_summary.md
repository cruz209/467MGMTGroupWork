In my analysis of NYC Citi Bike data, I identified two distinct user groups: Subscribers and Customers. Subscribers, who are primarily commuters, tend to take shorter and more frequent rides averaging around 13 minutes. In contrast, Customers—often tourists or casual riders take longer leisure trips averaging about 36 minutes. While Subscribers account for the majority of overall trips, I found that Customers generate higher engagement per ride, revealing a clear opportunity to grow revenue within the leisure segment.

When I examined trip timing patterns, I observed that weekday rides peak during morning and evening rush hours, reflecting commuter habits, whereas weekend rides are longer and peak around midday, suggesting recreational use. Weekdays dominate in trip volume, but weekends deliver higher per-ride value. These patterns indicate that adjusting pricing and bike allocation, such as offering commuter discounts during weekdays and premium leisure passes on weekends could help better align with rider behavior.

Looking deeper into station-level data, I noticed that Central Park and its surrounding hubs dominate on weekends, while Midtown locations like Pershing Square and Park Avenue experience weekday peaks. This confirms the presence of distinct commuter and leisure zones that Citi Bike could target through location-based promotions and optimized bike rebalancing strategies.

Overall, I concluded that Citi Bike’s future growth lies in leveraging its strong commuter base while expanding its focus on experience-driven weekend rides. By refining pricing structures, marketing efforts, and bike distribution strategies, Citi Bike can enhance profitability, user satisfaction, and operational efficiency across New York City.
