## Summary:

### Data Analysis Key Findings

*   **Distinct Rider Segments:** Subscribers (commuters) dominate weekday trips with short durations, while Customers (tourists/leisure riders) take longer trips mainly on weekends.
*   **Time-Based Demand Patterns:** Weekday ridership peaks during morning and evening rush hours, while weekend usage peaks midday, driven by recreational activity.
*   **Location-Specific Usage:** Central Park and tourist areas are weekend hotspots, while Midtown and business districts lead weekday commuting trips.

### Insights or Next Steps

*   **Dynamic Bike Redistribution:** Optimize bike availability using predictive data by adding more bikes near offices during weekdays and near parks or tourist zones on weekends.
*   **Targeted Infrastructure Investments:** Improve or expand docking capacity and bike lanes in high-demand areas like Central Park South and Midtown to reduce congestion.
*   **Refined Pricing and Marketing:** Adjust pricing structures (e.g., commuter discounts vs. leisure passes) and tailor marketing efforts to better align with distinct rider behaviors and maximize revenue.
