	In the analysis of “The Look”,an online retailer, there are many surface growing opportunities for the company. From the look that the total monthly revenue that the business generated over it has shown a great sign of positive relationship. Especially in the year of 2026, which made a great boost compared to the previous years. Even though there are some ups and downs during the years, overall it has a great increase in its revenue.   
	Another two important KPIs to consider when trying to increase the profit is the repeat purchase rate percentage and average order value. From examining the repeat purchase rate of last year, about 26.6% of the customers made another order after their first purchase and these can be the target for loyal programs. The moderate level of customer retention should be increased to have a stable customer segment for profit. Promotions on loyal programs, unique goods, and quality services are ways to attract more customers to become loyal to the platform. For the average order amount that the customer spends is around 86 dollars, and if we are able to increase the value, it is a new way to boost the revenue without acquiring new customers. It can also help to lower the budget on marketing, but to increase the categories of products and item quality to attract orders.  
	After investigating the  product category of accessories and focusing on customers aged from 18 to 30, it shows that many of the customers came from the search channel. It shows that “The Look” website is known as a website for accessories and clothing, we should focus on having advertisements for diverse brands of accessories and clothing offered to customers.   
	With the analysis of “The Look”, we look through different perspectives and validate the metrics of repeat purchase value to provide a specific presentation on our loyal customers. The validation took a closer look at the value by month instead of a year range, and to see if there is a trend in the repeat customer orders. It shows a decreasing trend on customer retention, which is important if we want to have a stable source of revenue.   
From all the analysis, it shows that “The Look” has an increasing revenue trend from the beginning, and has a high boost during the year of 2025\. To keep the growth of revenue and maintain a segment of loyal customers are important for the company to lower the risk of unstable revenue growth or recession. The company can start with a loyalty program and earn discounts as the customers join and offer more if customers spend a certain amount. Another action to take is to increase the uniqueness of the website by offer products from new brands, and unique brands that only sells at our website.
