I found the top 3 growth KPIs for the e-commerce dataset: 90-day average revenue trend, repeat purchase rate, and the average order value. The 90-day average revenue trend line shows a general upward movement over time, indicating that the business has been experiencing consistent growth in its revenue over the long term. The values, which stabilize in the $20,000s range further down the rows, suggest a healthy and sustained revenue performance after the initial period. Then, the repeat purchase rate tells us about the proportion of users who have made more than one purchase. This is approximately 37.54% and is a key indicator of customer loyalty and satisfaction. The average order value (AOV) is a crucial metric for understanding customer spending habits and the overall financial health of the business. The AOV was $86.27, which represents the average amount of money a customer spends per order. Through the daily, month-over-month (MoM), and year-over-year (YoY) growth percentage trends for revenue and orders. I found that both show a general upward trend over time, particularly evident in the positive YoY growth percentages. This indicates that the business is experiencing consistent expansion year after year. However, the MoM and daily growth percentages show more significant fluctuations, moving between positive and negative values. I deep-dived into accessories, and found that it generated a total revenue of $417,101.01 through total orders of 9756, but had no discount applied, and neither was it among the top 5 product categories by sales. Through traffic source analysis, I found that 70103 users shopped through search and placed 87829 orders. I found that 6777 orders were placed in Guangdong, which is a populous province in China. There were no discounts applied to any items sold, regardless of their region or traffic source.  

After validation, I found that there were indeed no discounts or markups applied to any of the items sold, regardless of their region or traffic source. This means that the items were sold for the exact amount they were initially advertised for, which is their retail price. I also computed the total revenue generated by region and found that this was consistent with the total orders placed by region. This indicates that the regions with the highest number of orders also generated the most revenue, which validates that they were indeed the top-performing regions by total orders placed, and there was no pricing disparity across the regions. This also suggests that the revenue depends on the volume of orders placed. 

The repeat purchase rate is low, given that this is an e-commerce industry, and I recommend potentially increasing this rate further through targeted retention efforts. My second recommendation would be to conduct a deeper profitability analysis by traffic source and optimize marketing investment based on customer lifetime value (CLTV) rather than just order volume. In simpler terms, looking at how many users belong to each traffic source is only part of the story. A more effective method would be to figure out how much money each customer from each source is likely to spend over their entire relationship with your business. I would calculate this through the Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) for each traffic source. The traffic sources with the highest CLTVs are where I would recommend investing most for marketing strategies.
